Fundamental Concepts of Version Control & GitHub’s Popularity
Version control tracks and manages changes in code, enabling collaboration, history tracking, and rollback capabilities. GitHub is popular due to its cloud-based repository hosting, collaboration tools, and integration with CI/CD workflows.

Maintaining Project Integrity with Version Control
It prevents data loss, facilitates team collaboration, tracks code changes, and ensures consistency by managing multiple contributors’ work efficiently.

Setting Up a New Repository on GitHub

Sign in to GitHub → Click "New repository"
Choose a name, description, visibility (public/private)
Initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
Clone the repository locally for development
Importance of a README File
A README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution details. It enhances collaboration by making the repository accessible and understandable.

Public vs. Private Repositories

Public: Open to everyone, good for open-source projects, but exposes code.
Private: Restricted access, better for confidential projects, but limits collaboration without manual access granting.
Making the First Commit to a GitHub Repository

Clone the repo → Modify files → git add . → git commit -m "Initial commit" → git push
Commits save changes with messages, helping track progress and revert if needed.
Branching in Git & Its Importance

Branches allow multiple features to be developed independently.
Create with git branch feature-name, switch with git checkout feature-name, merge with git merge feature-name.
Essential for parallel development and code isolation.
Role of Pull Requests in GitHub Workflow

A pull request lets contributors propose changes for review.
Steps: Fork/clone repo → Create a branch → Make changes → Commit & push → Open a PR → Review & merge.
Ensures code quality and smooth collaboration.
Forking vs. Cloning a Repository

Forking: Creates a copy under a different account, useful for contributing to external projects.
Cloning: Downloads a repo locally for development but keeps it linked to the original repository.
Issues & Project Boards in GitHub

Issues: Track bugs, feature requests, or tasks.
Project Boards: Organize workflow using Kanban-style boards.
Example: An open-source project uses issues to manage reported bugs and a project board to assign tasks.
Common Challenges & Best Practices in GitHub

Challenges: Merge conflicts, lost commits, incorrect branching.
Best Practices: Use descriptive commit messages, follow branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow), regularly sync with the main branch, and leverage PR reviews for quality control.
